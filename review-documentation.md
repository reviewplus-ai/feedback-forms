### Review Collection System Architecture

I'll create a review collection system that conditionally redirects users based on their rating. Here's how it will work:

## Core Components

```typescriptreact project="review-system"
...
```

## How It Works - Architecture Overview

This review collection system is designed to help businesses gather customer feedback and strategically direct customers based on their sentiment. Here's how it works:

### Core Functionality

1. **Initial Review Collection**

1. Customers are presented with a simple rating interface (typically 1-5 stars)
2. The form is branded with the company's logo and colors
3. The interface is clean and focused on getting a quick rating
4. Optional comment field for additional feedback
5. Mobile-responsive design for all devices

2. **Conditional Redirection**

1. When a customer submits a rating, the system evaluates it against a threshold
2. Positive ratings (e.g., 4-5 stars) redirect to public review platforms (Google Reviews, Trustpilot, etc.)
3. Negative ratings (e.g., 1-3 stars) redirect to a private feedback form (Google Forms, custom form, etc.)
4. Customizable redirect URLs for each company
5. Support for multiple review platforms per company

3. **Admin Dashboard**

1. Companies can create and manage multiple review forms
2. They can customize branding, messages, and redirect URLs
3. Analytics show review distribution and trends over time
4. Company management features:
   - Create/edit company profiles
   - Manage multiple review forms per company
   - Set up custom domains/subdomains
   - Configure review thresholds and redirects
   - View detailed analytics and reports
5. User management:
   - Add/remove team members
   - Set role-based permissions
   - Track user activity

### Technical Implementation

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, Server Actions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (or any SQL database)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **Hosting**: Vercel (recommended)
- **Analytics**: Built-in + optional Google Analytics integration

### Data Flow

1. Company creates a review form in the admin panel
2. System generates a unique URL for the company (e.g., `reviewflow.com/company-name`)
3. Customer visits the URL and submits a rating
4. System processes the rating and redirects accordingly:
   - Positive → Public review site (Google Reviews, etc.)
   - Negative → Private feedback form (Google Forms, etc.)
5. All data is stored for analytics and reporting

### Customization Options

Companies can customize various aspects of their review forms:

| Option | Description | Default
|-----|-----|-----|
| Form Name | Internal name for reference | -
| Form URL | Custom URL slug | Generated from name
| Company Name | Displayed on the form | -
| Welcome Message | Initial message to customers | "How would you rate your experience?"
| Thank You Message | Shown after submission | "Thank you for your feedback!"
| Rating Threshold | Minimum rating for positive path | 4
| Positive Redirect URL | Where to send positive reviews | -
| Negative Redirect URL | Where to send negative reviews | -
| Primary Color | Brand color for buttons and UI | `#4f46e5`
| Logo URL | Company logo image | -
| Enable Comments | Allow additional feedback | True
| Custom Domain | Company's own domain | -
| Review Platforms | Supported review sites | Google Reviews, Trustpilot, etc.
| Feedback Form | Custom feedback form URL | -

### Admin Panel Features

1. **Company Management**
   - Create and manage company profiles
   - Set up custom domains
   - Configure branding and styling
   - Manage team members and permissions

2. **Form Management**
   - Create and edit review forms
   - Configure redirect URLs
   - Set rating thresholds
   - Customize messages and branding

3. **Analytics Dashboard**
   - Review distribution charts
   - Response rate tracking
   - Conversion metrics
   - Export data functionality

4. **Settings & Configuration**
   - Company profile settings
   - Integration settings
   - Security settings
   - Notification preferences

### Security Considerations

- All form submissions use CSRF protection
- Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse
- Data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- Admin access requires strong authentication
- Role-based access control for team members
- Regular security audits and updates

### Maintenance and Updates

Regular maintenance tasks:

1. Database backups (daily)
2. Performance monitoring
3. Security updates
4. Feature enhancements based on user feedback
5. Platform integration updates
6. Analytics and reporting improvements

### Example Implementation

```typescript
"use server"

import { redirect } from "next/navigation"

export async function submitReview(formData: FormData) {
  // Process the review data
  const rating = parseInt(formData.get("rating") as string)
  const companyId = formData.get("companyId") as string
  const comment = formData.get("comment") as string
  
  // Get company configuration
  const company = await getCompanyConfig(companyId)
  
  // Store the review data
  await storeReview({
    companyId,
    rating,
    comment,
    timestamp: new Date()
  })
  
  // Determine where to redirect based on rating
  if (rating >= company.threshold) {
    redirect(company.positiveRedirectUrl) // 307 Temporary Redirect
  } else {
    redirect(company.negativeRedirectUrl) // 307 Temporary Redirect
  }
}
```

### Deployment

#### Vercel Deployment

```shellscript
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel
```

#### Environment Variables

Required environment variables for production:

```plaintext
